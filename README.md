# Image Clustering and Segmentation with KMeans

This project demonstrates how to perform image clustering and segmentation using KMeans clustering algorithm in Python. The code provided loads an image of a cat, reshapes it for clustering, applies KMeans to segment the image into distinct color regions, and then saves the original and segmented images. The segmented image has fewer colors, representing the clusters identified by the KMeans algorithm.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `opencv-python`

## Results
image1.png is the original image and is 155 kB in size.
image2.png is the segmented image and is 21.1 kB in size.
These images demonstrate how the KMeans clustering reduces the color complexity of the image, creating a segmented version with distinct color regions.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request or open an Issue to improve the project.
